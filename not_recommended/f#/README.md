Suave is a simple web development F# library providing a lightweight web server and a set of combinators to manipulate route flow and task composition.

This project has been created with Fsharp yeoman [generator](https://github.com/fsprojects/generator-fsharp).
It uses [Fake](http://fsharp.github.io/FAKE/) and [Paket](https://fsprojects.github.io/Paket/).


It can now run without Visual studio as well and on other platform using Mono.

You just need to run build.sh or build.cmd depending on your platform.

Good luck !
